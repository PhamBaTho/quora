This one hack may be known to all programmers but for others this might help.

Do you want to see the saved passwords which will be shown as 

**********

?




Right click on the password field and select inspect element from the menu.



A line of HTML code shows near the bottom section of the HTML page and one line will be shown selected.

For viewers sake i'm pasting that line

<input id="Passwd" name="Passwd" type="password" placeholder="Password" class="">

Double click on the type="password"
