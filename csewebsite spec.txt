There's nothing special about the number 10, so here's my arbitrary length list of websites computer science students should check out, with priority given to obscurity.

Github Explore and Github Student Developer Pack
Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform
Coursera, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare
HackerRank, TopCoder, USACO, ACM-ICPC
The Verge, Hacker News, Ars Technica
Stack Overflow, Quora, Google, Wikipedia

I've left off the hundreds of websites you should visit roughly once, for instance for learning a particular skill or for downloading some piece of software. These are super important too! In fact, here are a few of them:

scikit-learn: machine learning in Python
Redis
Flask (A Python Microframework)
Storm, distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation
Apache Kafka
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
The IPython Notebook
virtualenvwrapper 4.3.post18
Advanced Python Scheduler
jQuery
Apache Sparkâ„¢ - Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing
Alfred - Productivity App for Mac OS X

Lastly, Wikipedia pages like this one and Google searches like this one should keep you busy for ages.
