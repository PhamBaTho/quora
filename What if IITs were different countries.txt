What if IITs were different countries. Which country would they represent?

IIT Bombay - United States of America. Limited entries. Everyone wants it. It's top notch. Well developed. The best you can get.

IIT Delhi - United Kingdom. Much in demand. Also top notch. Central to the world (read - In Capital).

IIT Madras - China. Rising power. Dragons. Some weird laws. But is one of the most dominant power.

IIT Kharagpur - Russia. The biggest of them all. Huge and Powerful. Is in a state of cold war with it's western counterpart.

IIT Guwahati - Singapore. Young and Vibrant. Was born mysteriously but currently outshining a lot of it's western counterparts.

IIT Kanpur - Japan. Houses some of the most powerful supercomputers ever made. It's the industrial capital.

IIT Roorkee - India. Was once the best - the golden era. Still a power house but not as good.

IIT BHU - Nepal. To the north. Holy country for hindus. Recently re-branded we new set of rules.

ISM Dhanbad - Greenland. It's a big confusion if it's a nation ? It's independent and huge for sure.

IIT Mandi - Bhutan. Sits in the land of mountains. Strategically important.

IIT Hyderabad - United Arab Emirates. Young but doing great. Have developed a lot.

IIT Jodhpur - Egypt. Sits in the middle of a desert.

IIT Gandhinagar - Bangladesh. It has strong connection with it's nearby nations. Alcohol is banned here. Sshhh. Their celebrations are dull tongue emoticon

IIT Patna - Yemen. We need an evacuation plan really. Things are always uncertain in that part of the world

IIT Ropar - Canada. Lots of Panjabis. A relative cold country.

IIT Bhubaneshwar - Cambodia. A small country that no one has heard of and no one talks about.
