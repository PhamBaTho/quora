1. Read. Read everything. Read how people talk in novels. Read how people express themselves in essays. Learn how to use language by reading.

2. Listen. What is the difference between the way you speak and the way people you admire speak? Self-correct.

3. Avoid big words. Big words are for thinking. Small words are for speaking. One doesn't really understand something until one can explain it in small words.

4. Practice. You have to speak to become good at speaking. So talk to people.

5. Critique. Record yourself talking in a real (or imagined) conversation. Play it back and critique how you did. Listen for fumbles, um, er, ahs, mispronounced words, poor grammar. See if you get to the point or wander about aimlessly.

6. Repeat 3 and 4 as much as you can

7. Learn. Take a speech class or join Toastmasters International, where you will have to speak in public and be critiqued by others.

8. Wait. Be sure you have something to say before you speak.
